# ASMLearning
This is my ASM learning archive.

I'm working in Windows 11 so that will be my warning that the C sources included here will have #include <winmain.h> in them and in ASM they'll all be PE's or COFF's.

And it appears that I am going to have to write my own .gitignore for ASM. I had to write a custom .gitignore once before. Que sera.

## Project Ideas
Smallest Windows ASM x86-64 program.

Propely exiting an ASM program in Windows.

## Point of Interest (to me, at least)
I enjoy C as well as trying to learn ASM. So as a result, I enjoy seeing the differences in how the two different sets of source look and how they compile into a 1k ASM exe and a 60k C exe.

Plus this is a good exercise, imo, for being able to tell what ASM is in C or vice versa. I have a really old program that I keep trying to decompile and then rewrite in modern x86-64 C but can never get past the ASM in the debugger.

Anyway, I hope y'all find this as interesting as I do. Plus the learning experiences along the way.
